# Algorithmic Trading and Strategy Tester

This is a personal project I'm currently working on. When I have the time I love to test different algorthimic trading strategies on historical stock market data.  Inspiration and some boiler plate is from the udemy course *Algorithmic Trading A-Z with Python, Machine Learning and AWS*

Currently I'm testing strategies from various academic papers on technical analysis indicators.

In the future I plan to test succcesful strategies on paper markets and eventually connect it to mu interactive brokers account through their api.I also plan expand the tester to crypto currencies
